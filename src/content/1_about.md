<p>I Used the templete at https://github.com/elmsln/hax11ty to make this website
<ul>
  <li>User edits via HAX (future) or modifies files locally</li>
  <li>hax11ty script watches for changes and rebuilds files w/ 11ty, refreshing the screen</li>
  <li>this is compiled to a valid HAXcms data package to be used either completely static with a CDN or locally in HAXcms PHP version</li>
</ul>
